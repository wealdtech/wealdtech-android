Fabric data:
  - add getObfuscated() and setObfuscated(), which obfuscates both key and value in the data store
    - use Jam class already present in code to achieve this
  - add increment(val) to provide cleaner incrementing of existing values
    - useful for counters

Fabric view:
  - use fabric to (non-persistently) store view information on destory/create (e.g. on rotation)

Fabric activity:
  - configure counters which record visits, using well-known names with '__' prefix

PersistenceStore:
  - build a more intelligent persistence store which saves user information immediately but system stats (such as counters)
    only periodically.  Use '__' prefix to work out which are which

Fabric rules:
  - add triggers for other common android situations
    - focus gained, focus lost, list item(s) selected, spinner selected etc.

Fabric actions:
  - create walkthrough action; introductory help the first time a user visits an activity/clicks an item/etc
  - create divert action; provide a modal dialogue which either stays on the current activity or starts another activity
    depending on user selection

Fabric notifications:
  - additional module for managing notifications
    - notifications can be:
      - momentary: only around for a few seconds
        - e.g. 'Item has been created'
      - transient: around for the lifetime of the app
        - e.g. 'Please rate this app'
      - persistent: around until actioned
        - e.g. 'Do you want to accept this friend request?'
      all of which are just conditions of some sort or another
    - notifications can either be informational or have options and actions associated with them
    - display of notifications should be abstracted in the notification system
      - sample implementations should include an android-like handler (momentary -> Toast, transient and persistent -> dialogue)
        as well as a listview-like implementation where items can be handled when the user wishes (with the view popping up
        when the user activates it from e.g. navigation drawer or action bar)
